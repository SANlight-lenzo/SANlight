    <section id="explaination">
        <div class="explanation">
            <h2 class="Head">Head tag</h2>
            <p>
                In the first line of my code, I wrote !DOCTYPE html. This declaration is important because it informs the 
                browser about the version of HTML being used.

                HTML was developed by Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee, commonly known as TimBL, in 1980. Over the years, HTML has seen
                several advancements, including the introduction of new tags and attributes. The different versions of HTML include HTML 1.0,
                HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.0, and HTML 5.0. HTML 1.0 lacks many tags and attributes that are available in HTML 5.0, making it
                essential to specify the version you are using to avoid confusion.
                Moreover, providing these details can increase the chances of your website ranking higher in search results for relevant content.
                Failing to include such attributes may result in lower rankings, which reflects the importance of adhering to proper web standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                In line two, I wrote html lang="en". This tag serves as both the HTML opening tag and specifies the language of the webpage. For instance, if your webpage is in Kikuyu, you would write lang="ki", whereas for English, you would use lang="en", for Spanish lang="es", and for French lang="fr". This attribute is crucial for site accessibility, translations, and SEO purposes.

The lang value must be a 2-character code from the ISO Language Code list.

Examples include:

en for English,

de for German,

zh for Chinese and 

zu for Zulu

Values can also specify regions, such as en-GB for English from Great Britain, and so forth.
                <ul>
                    <li>lang on html opening tag defines the language for a page<br></li>
                    <li>lang on paragraph tag defines the language for a paragraph<br></li>
                    <li>lang on input tag defines the language for an input control<br></li>
                    <li>lang on textarea tag defines the language for a textarea<br></li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <h4>Meta Data</h4>
            <p>
                It is found within the head tag.<br>Metadata is essentially data about data. It provides information 
                about other data, helping to make it easier to find, use, and manage. Here are a few examples of metadata:
                <ul>
                    <li>Photography: A photo's metadata can contain details like the camera settings, date and time the photo was taken, location, and more.</li>
                    <li>Library: A book's metadata might include its title, author, publication date, genre, and ISBN number.</li>
                    <li>Webpages: HTML metadata can include information about the page's content, keywords, author, and language, which are used by search engines.</li><br>
                    By describing the nature, purpose, and scope of data, metadata makes it easier to understand and manage the actual data it's associated with.
                </ul>


                <h4>Charset</h4>
                In line 6, I wrote the meta charset command. You might be wondering, what is charset? Charset stands for character set.
                I'm sure at some point, you've come across Arabic text, Russian, or Kikuyu. Some letters in Kikuyu are not included in
                our kindergarten curriculum design, so how do we handle this? Well, here's the explanation. We have many characters in 
                the world, known as letters across various languages and cultures. To accommodate this, computer scientists developed a
                solution—a common set of characters present in most international languages. The most common character set is UTF-8.
                It includes letters from A-Z, numbers 0-9, and symbols like @, #, $, %, &, *, (, ), _. Basically, any character 
                found on a QWERTY keyboard is part of UTF-8.
            </p>

            <h4>viewport</h4>
            <p>
                The viewport is the area of the webpage that is visible to the user on their screen. It's essentially the "window"
                through which users view the web content.
                When designing and developing web pages, it's crucial to consider the viewport, especially with the rise of mobile
                devices with varying screen sizes. Here are some key points about the viewport:
                Viewport Meta Tag: The meta name="viewport" tag allows you to control the layout on mobile browsers. For example, 
                meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" ensures that the webpage scales properly
                 across different devices.
            </p>

            <h4>Title tag</h4>
            <p>
                In line 8, I wrote the title tag. Any text that appears between the two opening and closing title tags, will be displayed
                as the name of the webpage tab. as illustrated below. 
            </p>
            <abbr title="favicon and title"><img src="C:\Users\Hp 450 g3\OneDrive\Desktop\pHA5i\Programming HUB\Project pHA5i\Notes\Screenshot 2024-11-17 221150.png"alt="title tag how it appers" class="favicon"></abbr>
            <abbr title="favicon and title"><img src="C:\Users\Hp 450 g3\OneDrive\Desktop\pHA5i\Programming HUB\Project pHA5i\Notes\Screenshot 2024-11-15 195455.png" alt="Text between Tile tag"></abbr>

            <h4>link</h4>
            <p>
                In line 9, I wrote link rel="stylesheet" href="index 1.css". Sasa hapa ndio kizungu mkuti. Link command is used any time you want
                to bring an external element in the website and in this situation what we want to bring in or link is a CSS file, so 
                what do we do?<br>
                Rel in full means relationship so we are specifying the relationship between my HTML file and my CSS file. The relationship here 
                is stylesheet.
                Stylesheet because what CSS does is to apply styling to the HTML elements. <br>Href, big word ain't it? In full
                it means hypertext reference, so what is hypertext refernce?<br>
                Hypertext is basically a link path, that's it. Inside the qoutes we are to specify the path of accessing our css file. 
                However, if you are ever making a website step one is always create a folder will contain everything which we will upload 
                to the internet using NETLIFY. Since all our assets are contained in one folder we do not need to write the file path
                beginning with Drive and subsequent folders, we only write the the file name and boom you have learnt to link CSS to 
                your HTML file.
            </p>
            <p>
                In line 10, I linked an element that I defined its relationship to be icon, then I provided the hypertext reference
                and lastly i have introduced a new HTML attribute. <span id="type">TYPE attribute.</span> Go
                to your favourite website at the top on the webpage tab I hope you noticed a small picture. It is called a favicon.<br>
                The favicon syntax is written as follows link, define the relationship as icon, provide the hypertext reference 
                and finally type attributes sholud always be set to image/x-icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you start learning CSS you will come to know that there is something called websafe fonts, so what are websafe fonts.
                These are fonts thst are suppported by most web broswers. They are around ten, so how does this work?

                <abbr title="Websafe fonts, families"><img src="C:\Users\Hp 450 g3\OneDrive\Desktop\pHA5i\Programming HUB\Project pHA5i\Notes\Screenshot 2024-11-18 085140.png" alt="web safe fonts." id="websafe-fonts"></abbr>
            </div>
                The first font family is Courier New. If you select it as your desired font family, a client will request for the website.
                If your broswer has the font pre-installed it will render the page in Courier New. If Courier New is not available
                , the page will be rendered in courier and still if your broswer lacks courier new it will be rendered in monospace.<br>
                However, as a developer you want to achieve the best work as possible so you will want to use some fonts that are not websafe 
                (pre-installed in broswers). how is this achieved?<br>
                Well google has you covered. Google has a large database of fonts that varying on different functions. For example if you want
                a font for a birthday website just search "birthday fonts google fonts". Write a brief description of the font folllowed by 
                "Google Fonts". When you open the website you will find suggestions on the type of fonts available.

                    <div>
                <p>
                    Copy the code specified head tag, copy and paste it within your head tags.<br>
                    Do the same with your CSS code paste it any where in your CSS file. It does not need to be within selectors. Everytime you 
                    need to call for it type the name of your font-family and there you have it! You have imported an external font!

        <p>
            This section is going to be long as we delve in some deep concepts in HTML. So without much further ado let's begin.<br>
            These are some of the tags we are going to be learning about.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>h1 to h6 tags</li>
                <li>Paragraph tag</li>
                <li>Section tag</li>
                <li>div tag</li>
                <li>img tag</li>
                <li>Navigation tag</li>
                <li>abbreviation tag</li>
                <li>ul tag</li>
                <li>li tag</li>
                <li>header tag</li>
                <li>footer tag</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h4>h1 to h6 tags</h4>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has a way of creating heading titles whose font size is already preset.
            If you want a heading with the largest font size as compared to other text simply use h1. As you go down the hierachy you
            will realise that the font size decreases gradually. Try it on your own and you will learn how to use them for your benefit.
        </p>

        <h4>Paragraph tag</h4>
        <p>
            If you want to write text in HTML the paragraph tag is used. It creates a paragraph where text is input. If you want to 
            move to the next paragraph simply write another paragraph tag and a new paragraph will be began. Sometimes, you may want 
            to move to the next line without beginning a new paragraph. No worries you can use the break tag. <code>br</code>.<br>
        </p>

        <h4>Section tag</h4>
        <p>
            Section tag is used when dividing the area on the screen into divisons that occupy 100% of the width and a defined 
            height.
        </p>
        <h4>DIV tag</h4>
        <p>
            DIV tag is used to create a box container that encloses elements, it remains invisible until styling is applied 
            to it such as background color and adding borders.
        </p>

        <h4>Image tag</h4>
        <p>
            img tag used when linking an image into a HTML document, followed by "src". src in full means source,therefore, one should specify
            file path of the image you are linking. You must have noticed the words alt. sometimes, when you link an image from another website 
            into your website and it gets pulled down from the web then your website will not render anything where you had placed the image. 
            So this where alt attribute comes to the rescue. When an image fails to be rendered the text in the alt attribute is rendered
            instead. For example, you have a website about football news and in your website you have a picture of Ronaldo making
            a bicycle kick. You had imported this picture from BBC NEWS and it gets pulled down from BBC NEWS  so what will 
            happen. The brief description you provided about what the image was about will be rendered instead.<br>
            Also it has another purpose. We have blind people who may be surfing through your website for information. The text-to-
            speech engine will read the text out loud for the blind person but what will happen when it reaches an image.
            Well it justs reads out the brief description you provided it the alternative attribute.<br>Remember the penalty of 
            ignoring such minor details is that your website will always rank lower.  
        </p>

        <h4>Navigation tag</h4>
        <p>
            nav tag is used when creating navigation buttons or links.
        </p>

        <h4>Abbreviation tag</h4>
        <p>
            Abbreviation tag is used when you want to write the full meaning of an abbreviation. For example you want to write
            the full meaning of the word AGDA. I will enclose <abbr title="Agency for Governance and Development in Africa">AGDA</abbr> in abbr tags, then in the opening tag I will provide 
            the title attribute, in which any text inside it is rendered anytime the cursor hovers over the words <abbr title="Agency for Governance and Development in Africa">AGDA</abbr>.
        </p>

        <h4>Unordered list tag</h4>
        <P>
            ul tag is used to create a unordered list while ol tag is used to create an ordered list. ul list use bullets while
